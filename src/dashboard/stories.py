- There have been a significant number of growth maximum number of spaces available on recond for a given year.
- The Coast Fraser region which consits of highly populated and rapidly growing  cities such as langley and Surrey, has experienced the most rapid growth  both in absolute numbers and percentage. 
    - This region has seen a 2X increase in the spaces available for Coast Fraser region
- This is followed at a distance by the Vancouver Island and Interior regions whcih seem to have a similar annula growth pattern, even though there are more spances in the Vancouver island region
- The least growth in see in the norther region
- There has been a 2X increase in the spaces available for Coast Fraser region


Looking at the yearly growth trends:, 
- the sharpest increase in the number of total spaces was recorded between 2021-2022, from about 2500 to over 5000 spaces in 2022
- This peak in 2021 may be linked to the government intervention.

- There has been a significant growth in number of licensed facilities (from less than 2000 in 2023, to over 3000) 
with an even sharper increase 
in the number of spaces which has doubled in the same period.

- The growth in the spaces, appears to be largely driven by gr03 (Group care for children aged 3 years to kindergarten.),
